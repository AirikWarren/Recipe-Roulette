Recipe Roulette
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Script searches for a recipe "semi-randomly" using recipepuppy.com's API (http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/).
The user has the option of inputting an ingredient they would like the recipe to use, if they do not input
an ingredient one will be chosen at random to guide the search.
